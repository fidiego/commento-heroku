# Commento++

![Commento++ in action](https://i.imgur.com/x4IA22n.gif)

DEMO: https://demo.souradip.com/chat.html

Commento++ is a platform that you can embed in your website to allow your readers to add comments. It's reasonably fast lightweight. Supports markdown, import from Disqus, voting, automated spam detection, moderation tools, sticky comments, thread locking, OAuth login, single sign-on, and email notifications.

### Modified to Run on Heroku in Docker Container and autoupdate with GitLab upstream

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus)

This repo is set up to pull updates from the [GitLab master of Commento](https://gitlab.com/commento/commento/) and merge them with [fidiego's heroku deploy script](https://github.com/fidiego/commento-heroku). It's also set to autodeploy when there's a new commit onto my heroku, so my version should stay constantly updated ;)

### Commento (original description)

##### [Homepage](https://commento.io) &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; [Demo](https://demo.commento.io) &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; [Documentation](https://docs.commento.io) &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; [Contributing](https://docs.commento.io/contributing/) &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; [#commento on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23commento)


###### How is this different from Disqus, Facebook Comments, and the rest?

Most other products in this space do not respect your privacy; showing ads is their primary business model and that nearly always comes at the users' cost. Commento has no ads; you're the customer, not the product. While Commento is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), in order to keep the service sustainable, the [hosted cloud version](https://commento.io) is not offered free of cost. Commento is also orders of magnitude lighter than alternatives.

###### Why should I care about my readers' privacy?

For starters, your readers value their privacy. Not caring about them is disrespectful and you will end up alienating your audience; they won't come back. Disqus still isn't GDPR-compliant (according to their <a href="https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/privacy-faq" title="At the time of writing (28 December 2018)" rel="nofollow">privacy policy</a>). Disqus adds megabytes to your page size; what happens when a random third-party script that is injected into your website turns malicious?
